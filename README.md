# Autumn (GPT-4o generated)

Autumn is a powerful, spring-like framework designed to simplify dependency injection (DI) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP) in your Golang projects. By leveraging compile-time code generation, Autumn ensures optimal performance and reliability.

## Key Features

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Simplifies the management of your application's dependencies, promoting clean, maintainable, and testable code.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) [TODO]:** Provides a flexible way to modularize cross-cutting concerns (like logging, authorization, and transaction management) separately from your main business logic.
- **Compile-Time Code Generation:** Ensures that the code related to DI and AOP is generated at compile-time, leading to better performance and type safety.

## Installation

To include Autumn in your project, you can use `go get` to fetch the package:

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/autumn
```

Ensure that this URL points to the correct path of the Autumn repository.

## Quick Start

Here's a brief example to get you started with Autumn.

### Step 1: Define Your Services

Create a new file named `services.go` and define your services.

```go
package main

type HelloService struct {
}

func (h *HelloService) SayHello() string {
    return "Hello, Autumn!"
}
```

### Step 2: Write Your Main Application

Create another file `main.go` for your main application logic.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/yourusername/autumn"
)

func main() {
    app := autumn.NewApp()
    helloService := &HelloService{}
    app.Inject(helloService)

    fmt.Println(helloService.SayHello())
}
```

### Step 3: Generate and Build

Run the code generator tool provided by Autumn:

```bash
go generate
```

Then build and run your application:

```bash
go build -o myapp
./myapp
```
